## Notes
He uses the reclist from felinewasteland.

Karya was made in an Armenian lab on accident while scientists were experimenting on a test subject by modifying a human using planarian genes to test limb regeneration, but one of genes were copied twice, so when they removed the limb, it ended up turning into Karya. They tested him and microchipped him but let him go because he had inherited the regeneration powers meaning he could asexually reproduce. Karya has escaped the lab since.
